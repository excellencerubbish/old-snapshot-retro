A quick asset test with the initial verison of the mariner.

Has sliders to adjust size and count for the asset.

100x100 for ten units w/ 125x125 bounding boxes seems like a good option, but may not fit onto smaller screen sizes. Mobile styling seems like it's gonna be a huge pain, have to think more on it. At this point, I'm thinking it may be a good idea to reduce number of units to 8 or 9. We's be able to get away with padding/margins (125 * 9 = 1125) with a minium assumed screen width of 1280 for laptops.
